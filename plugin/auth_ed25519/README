This plugin uses public domain ed25519 code
by Daniel J. Bernstein, Niels Duif, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe, Bo-Yin Yang.

It is "ref10" implementation from the SUPERCOP:
https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html

OpenSSH also uses ed25519 from SUPERCOP, but "ref" implementation.

There are four ed25519 implementations in SUPERCOP, ref10 is faster then ref,
and there are two that are even faster, written in amd64 assembler.
Benchmarks are here: https://bench.cr.yp.to/impl-sign/ed25519.html
